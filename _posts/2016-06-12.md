<h1>What is Flask?

Flask is a micro framework(lightweight) which allows the user to be able to use the http protocol to create a RESTFUL application.

RESTFUL??

This is an application that conforms to the REST standards such as :

Stateless : which means that the server side does not store any data from the client while executing.

Client -server : This application uses a client server architecture  which means that it has an independent back end and front end.

Cacheable : this means that the application is able to store information to improve its response.

 

Flask is used together with python to interact between servers and applications through the http protocol.
