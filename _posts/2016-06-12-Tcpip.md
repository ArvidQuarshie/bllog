<h1>The TCP/IP</h1>
TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) is the basic communication language or protocol of the Internet.
It can also be used as a communications protocol in a private network (either an intranet or an extranet).

TCP/IP uses the client/server model of communication in which a computer user (a client) requests and is provided a service (such as sending a Web page) by another computer (a server) in the network. 
TCP/IP communication is primarily point-to-point, meaning each communication is from one point (or host computer) in the network to another point or host computer. 
TCP/IP and the higher-level applications that use it are collectively said to be "stateless" because each client request is considered a new request unrelated to any previous one (unlike ordinary phone conversations that require a dedicated connection for the call duration). 
Being stateless frees network paths so that everyone can use them continuously. Note :that the TCP layer itself is not stateless as far as any one message is concerned. 
Its connection remains in place until all packets in a message have been received.
